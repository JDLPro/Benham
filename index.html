    What happens if we change how many lines there are, how far apart they are from one another, or how long the lines are? 
    Do certain speeds make the effect better or worse for you? 
      Using this virtual model you can explore some of these questions for yourself and share it with friends!
What causes the colors we see with Benham's disk is unknown.
This model uses JavaScript and Phaser 3.17.
    <br><br>
      Everything below is only black and white. What causes the colors some see with Benham's disk is completely unknown, with limited study.
    <br><br>
      Displaying it in a virtual setting presents a new set of challenges and also provides a means by which to explore some aspects of the phenomena.
      It is now possible to adjust the speed of the spinning disk! Just click and drag the white lever on the left.
    <br><br>
      There is also a second white lever that controls how many black lines you see in the white spaecs. 
      Different speeds and divisions may give you different results!
